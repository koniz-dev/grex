## 🔴 Critical (Must Fix Before Production)

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Sanitize logging interceptor to remove Authorization tokens
- [ ] Implement token expiration checking
- [ ] Add session timeout mechanism
- [ ] Test token refresh flow thoroughly

### Data Protection
- [ ] **Implement SSL certificate pinning**
- [ ] Sanitize all logged data (requests, responses, errors)
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest (if required)
- [ ] Remove sensitive data from crash reports

### Code Security
- [ ] **Enable code obfuscation for release builds**
- [ ] **Configure proper Android release signing** (remove debug signing)
- [ ] Add production build guards (prevent debug code in production)
- [ ] Review and remove any hardcoded secrets/API keys
- [ ] Add ProGuard rules for Android

### Platform Security
- [ ] **Add network security config for Android**
- [ ] **Configure App Transport Security for iOS**
- [ ] **Add security headers to web version**
- [ ] Disable backup for Android (or configure backup rules)
- [ ] Configure proper AndroidManifest.xml security settings

## 🟡 High Priority (Fix Within 1-2 Sprints)

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Add biometric authentication option
- [ ] Implement device fingerprinting for fraud detection
- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints

### Data Protection
- [ ] Implement request/response encryption for sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Add clipboard protection (auto-clear sensitive data)
- [ ] Implement secure file storage for sensitive documents

### Code Security
- [ ] **Add root/jailbreak detection**
- [ ] Implement anti-tampering checks
- [ ] Add debugger detection
- [ ] Set up dependency vulnerability scanning

### Platform Security
- [ ] Configure Android App Links

---

## 🟢 Medium Priority (Fix Within 1 Month)

### Compliance
- [ ] **Implement GDPR consent management**
- [ ] **Add data deletion functionality** (Right to be Forgotten)
- [ ] **Add data export functionality** (GDPR requirement)
- [ ] Create privacy policy screen
- [ ] Add cookie consent for web version

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up security event logging
- [ ] Implement security monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Add suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Set up crash reporting (sanitized)

### Testing
- [ ] Perform penetration testing
- [ ] Test on rooted/jailbroken devices
- [ ] Test SSL pinning with proxy tools
- [ ] Security-focused code review
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan

- [ ] **Within 24 hours:** Notify affected users (if required)
- [ ] **Within 48 hours:** Notify regulatory bodies (if required)
- [ ] **Within 1 week:** Complete investigation
- [ ] **Within 2 weeks:** Implement fixes
- [ ] **Within 1 month:** Post-incident review
